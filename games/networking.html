        carefully will give you all the information you need to solve the
        puzzles!
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Concepts You Need to Know:</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s go over the basic concepts of networking. Understanding these will
      help you fill in the blanks correctly!
    </p>

    <!-- Explanation for IP Addresses -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>1. IP Addresses</h3>
      <p>
        Every device on a network has an **IP address**. This is a unique
        address that identifies devices on a network (like your phone, computer,
        or server).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two versions of IP addresses: **IPv4** and **IPv6**. IPv4
        addresses are made up of four numbers between 0 and 255, separated by
        dots.
      </p>
      <p>For example: <code>192.168.1.1</code> is a common IPv4 address.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation for TCP/IP -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>2. TCP/IP</h3>
      <p>
        TCP/IP is the **language** of the internet. It is the protocol that
        defines how data is broken down into smaller pieces called **packets**
        and sent across networks. The receiving device then **reassembles** the
        packets to read the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        TCP ensures that packets are delivered in the correct order and without
        errors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation for HTTP -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>3. HTTP</h3>
      <p>
        HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of the **World Wide
        Web**. It is how browsers communicate with servers to request and
        display web pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you type a URL like <code>https://example.com</code> in your
        browser, it sends an **HTTP request** to the server asking for the web
        page, and the server responds with the page data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation for DNS -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>4. DNS (Domain Name System)</h3>
      <p>
        DNS is like the **phonebook** of the internet. It translates **domain
        names** (like <code>www.example.com</code>) into IP addresses (like
        <code>192.168.1.1</code>) so that computers can communicate with each
        other.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you enter a website’s name into the browser, a DNS server looks up
        the IP address for that domain name and helps your device connect to the
        correct server.
      </p>

        page!</strong

    <p class="hint">
      <strong>Hint:</strong> You’ll need to fill in the blanks on the next page
      based on what you’ve learned here. Don’t worry if you can’t remember
      everything—there will be hints on the next page too!

    <p>
      Now it’s time to apply what you’ve learned! Fill in the blanks in each
      challenge. Work quickly and accurately—time is ticking!
    </p>

    <!-- Challenge 1 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 1: IP Addresses</h3>
      <p>Fill in the missing numbers to complete this IPv4 address:</p>
      <p>
        <code
          >192.<span class="fill-in"></span>.<span class="fill-in"></span
          >.1</code
        >
        <span class="hint">// Each number should be between 0 and 255</span>
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenge 2 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 2: TCP/IP</h3>
      <p>Fill in the blanks about how data travels through the network:</p>
      <p>
        When data is sent, it is broken into smaller pieces called
        <span class="fill-in"></span>. TCP makes sure these pieces arrive in the
        correct <span class="fill-in"></span> at the destination.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenge 3 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 3: HTTP</h3>
      <p>Fill in the blanks to complete this HTTP transaction:</p>
      <p>
        The browser sends an <span class="fill-in"></span> to the server asking
        for the webpage. The server then sends back a
        <span class="fill-in"></span> with the webpage data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenge 4 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 4: DNS</h3>
      <p>Fill in the blanks to explain how DNS works:</p>
      <p>
        The browser sends the domain name to a
        <span class="fill-in"></span> server, which looks up the corresponding
        <span class="fill-in"></span> address and returns it so the browser can
        connect to the correct server.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Expected Output Section 
<div class="output-container">
    <div class="output-title">Expected Output Examples:</div>
    <p>Challenge 1: A valid IPv4 address, like <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</p>
    <p>Challenge 2: Packets and order.</p>
    <p>Challenge 3: Request and response.</p>
