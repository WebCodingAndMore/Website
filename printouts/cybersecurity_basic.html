    </ol>

    <h2>Concepts You Need to Know:</h2>
    <p>
      Let’s go over the basic concepts of cybersecurity. Understanding these
      will help you fill in the blanks correctly!
    </p>

    <!-- Explanation for Passwords -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>1. Passwords</h3>
      <p>
        Your password is your first line of defense. It’s important to use
        strong, unique passwords for each account.
      </p>
      <p>
        A **strong password** should be at least 12 characters long and include
        a mix of letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and symbols.
      </p>
      <p>Example of a weak password: <code>password123</code></p>
      <p>Example of a strong password: <code>G4$hY8_&lP9</code></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation for Encryption -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>2. Encryption</h3>
      <p>
        **Encryption** scrambles data so that only the person with the correct
        key can read it. It helps keep your information safe from hackers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when you send a message online, encryption changes it from
        readable text (like “Hello”) to scrambled code (like
        <code>9f1e0a</code>) that only the recipient can decode.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is especially important when sending sensitive information, like
        passwords or personal data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation for Firewalls -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>3. Firewalls</h3>
      <p>
        A **firewall** is a security system that monitors and controls incoming
        and outgoing network traffic. It acts like a gatekeeper, blocking
        unwanted connections and allowing trusted ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firewalls help protect your device from attacks by filtering traffic and
        preventing unauthorized access.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Explanation for Phishing -->
    <div class="explanation">
      <h3>4. Phishing</h3>
      <p>
        **Phishing** is a type of cyberattack where a hacker pretends to be
        someone you trust to steal your information.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might get an email that looks like it’s from your bank
        asking you to “verify your account.” But the email is fake, and clicking
        the link could give hackers access to your account.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always check if the sender’s email address looks suspicious, and never
        click on links or download attachments from unknown sources!
      </p>
    </div>

      <strong>Hint:</strong> You’ll need to fill in the blanks on the next page
      based on what you’ve learned here. Don’t worry if you can’t remember
      everything—there will be hints on the next page too!

    <p>
      Now it’s time to apply what you’ve learned! Fill in the blanks in each
      challenge. Work quickly and accurately—time is ticking!
    </p>

    <!-- Challenge 1 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 1: Passwords</h3>
      <p>Which password is stronger, and why?</p>
      <p><code>password123</code> or <code>G4$hY8_&lP9</code></p>
      <p>
        Answer: <span class="fill-in"></span>
        <span class="hint"
          >// Think about length and the variety of characters used.</span
        >
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenge 2 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 2: Encryption</h3>
      <p>Fill in the blanks to explain how encryption protects your data:</p>
      <p>
        Encryption **scrambles** your data, making it unreadable to anyone who
        doesn’t have the <span class="fill-in"></span>. Only the person with the
        correct <span class="fill-in"></span> can decrypt the data and read it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenge 3 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 3: Firewalls</h3>
      <p>Fill in the blanks to describe what a firewall does:</p>
      <p>
        A firewall acts as a **gatekeeper** for your network. It monitors
        <span class="fill-in"></span> traffic and decides whether to allow or
        block it based on security rules.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Challenge 4 -->
    <div class="challenge-container">
      <h3>Challenge 4: Phishing</h3>
      <p>Fill in the blanks to avoid phishing attacks:</p>
      <p>
        Phishing attacks often come in the form of **fake emails** that look
        like they’re from trusted sources. Always check the sender’s
        <span class="fill-in"></span> address and avoid clicking on suspicious
        <span class="fill-in"></span> or downloading unknown attachments.
      </p>
