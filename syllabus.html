      <h2>Homework Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        The goal of this class is to help you find something you enjoy doing in
        technology, whether that be design, coding, networks, databases or even
        an area of technology we don't cover in this class.
      </p>
      <p>
        During class we will cover what is listed above for each class and I
        expect you to fully participate and be engaged with the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the purpose of the material covered in class is not for you to
        become expert in it. It is simply to see if this is an area of
        technology you might enjoy working in in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore what this class is really about is helping you find a passion
        that may eventually become your career or maybe just a hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        To that end, your homework each week is to spend 1-3 hours outside of
        class doing something you find interesting about technology. It could
        have nothing to do at all with what we covered in the last class or any
        class. It may be the same project every week for the whole semester, a
        new project every week, or even multiple projects in one week. You
        choose what you want to work on each week.
      </p>
      <p>
        During those 1-3 hours, or at the very end, I want you to document the
        work you've done. It doesn't matter to me if you write it down and take
        a picture of it, type it out in a Google Doc or Sheet, take a video,
        record yourself talking, anything at all. Feel free to be creative with
        how you document the time you've spent on your homework.
      </p>
      <p>
        To submit your documentation, go to Google Classroom and find the link
        for the most recent class and upload your documentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Submissions will be judged on the extent to which they show 1-3 hours of
        effort were spent on project work. You may not reuse a project from
        another class. Extra credit will be given if the documentation shows
        mistakes that were made and how you learned from those mistakes. Working
        in technology means making lots of mistakes and learning from them so
        the more you show that, the more points you get.
